# odin-recipes
This was a fun first project to introduce me to HTML.
I added two recipes that I have made, and one that I haven't (maybe you can figure out which).
I used a variety of pictures to make it more fun and utilized most of what was taught in the HTML foundations section.
I also added some more things later like background pictures. 
Overall, it was a simple but fun way to practice writing some HTML and creating a rudimentary website. I hope readers enjoy!
