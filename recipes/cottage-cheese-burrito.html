  <p class="recipe-subheading">Description:</p>
  <p>A cottage cheese burrito is a surprisingly tasty dish made with uncommon ingredients. Don't let the name fool you -
    it's nothing like a common burrito. <br>It also packs a surprising amount of protein and is easy to make.
  </p>
  <p class="recipe-subheading">Ingredients:</p>
  <ul style="margin-top:-15px;" type="square">
    <li>Burrito-sized tortilla (corn or flour)</li>
    <li>2 oz sharp cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>60g 2% cottage cheese</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>Garlic powder</li>
    <li>Chipotle seasoning</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Olive/canola/vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Sriracha sauce</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="recipe-subheading">Directions:</p>
  <ol style="margin-top:-15px;" type="i">
    <li>Crack open and beat the two eggs.</li>
    <li>Drizzle some olive oil on a pan and set it to low heat so the eggs do not sizzle when poured in.</li>
    <li>While the eggs are cooking, lay out the tortilla on the plate and spread the cheese out on it in a rectangular,
      finished burrito shape shape.</li>
    <li>Microwave the open tortilla with the cheese on it for 30s. This makes the tortilla soft enough for folding and
      melts the cheese.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle garlic powder, salt and chipotle seasoning on the egg, to taste.</li>
    <li>Fold a third of the omelette from both sides towards the middle so it has a rectangular shape and will fit over
      the cheese on the tortilla.</li>
    <li>Flip the omelette to get the other side nice and cooked.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, trim the ends of the omelette so it is rectangular and place it on the cheese on the tortilla.</li>
    <li>Eat the trimmed ends or place it over the rectangular omelette piece - whatever you prefer.</li>
    <li>Do not turn off the heat yet, leave the pan on.</li>
    <li>Drain the cottage cheese liquid and lay the curds out on top of the egg. Be careful so the curds do not spill
      out of the rectangular form.</li>
    <li>Fold the tortilla into a burrito shape. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAbpVXEUt_c">This video shows
        you how to properly fold a burrito.</a></li>
    <li>Toast the burrito on either side with the heat turned up some more. The high heat ensures that the burrito gets
      cooked quickly, and won't tear.</li>
    <li>Once done toasting, place it on a paper towel and cut it in half.</li>
    <li>Highly recommend dipping it in sriracha sauce while eating it.</li>
    <li>Bon Appetit!</li>
